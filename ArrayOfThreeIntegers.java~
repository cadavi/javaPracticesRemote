/*Write a method that takes as input an array of integers and returns an array of
three integers. You can assume that the input array contains at least three elements.
The returned array should contain the three consecutive elements in the input array
with the biggest sum. For example, if the input array is {3,6,5,2,6}, then the output
array should be: {3,6,5} because 3+6+5=14, which is bigger than 6+5+2=13 and
5+2+6=13. Write a full program that tests the method.*/

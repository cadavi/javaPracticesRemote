/*
Write a program that prints five random playing cards, where all cards must be
different. Example output is: “queen of spades”, “ten of clubs”, “three of diamonds”,
“five of hearts”, “seven of spades”. Use the enum construct for both the value and suit
of the card. The value of a card can be: “two”, “three”, “four”, “five”, “six”, “seven”,
“eight”, “nine”, “ten”, “Jack”, “Queen”, “King”, or “Ace”. The suit of a card can be
“spades”, “hearts”, “diamonds”, or “clubs”. Store the cards in an ArrayList. Before
inserting a new card in the ArrayList, ensure that the card is not already in the list.
